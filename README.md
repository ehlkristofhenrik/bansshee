# âœ¨ Banish âœ¨ 
> The Open Source SSH Server and Proxy Firewall Powered by AI ðŸ§ 

### ðŸš§ Under construction!

This project is yet incomplete and as of now unusable but I am going to develop it in the open.

### What is this?

Banish is my university thesis/hobby project. My goal is to provide an SSH server with some very spicy AI features. I want to bring some new and fresh paradigms to the table.

### Why though?

AI is coming whether we want/need it or not and I think  that Open Source is the way to go. By Open Source I mean a collaborative, source code openly-accessible project. 

### License TLDR

Traditional open-source licenses are not enough.

I added restrictions because I feel that people should not be regulated, companies and governments are.

* Personal & University: You are free to use and fork our project as long as you keep the license, state changes ( you know, GPL ) and you can not sell it.
* Commertial & Business: You have to buy a license. Oh yeah, and be nice to your users!
* Special: Feel free to request a free license! This is for stuff like Nonprofit orgs, small teams and alike. I will get back to you.

### Project values

* Everyone gets features **equally**, and at the **same time**
* Everyone has **equal right to vote** for the direction of the project
* Every change to the license applies onwards. Older versions keep the same license as they had.
* You are free to contribute / have your own version.
