> The Open Source SSH Server and Proxy Firewall Powered by AI ðŸ§ 

### ðŸš§ Under construction!

This project is yet incomplete and as of now unusable but I am going to develop it in the open.

### What is this?

Banish is my university thesis/hobby project. My goal is to provide an SSH server with some very spicy AI features. I want to bring some new and fresh paradigms to the table. This should mostly be used for remote servers eg.: AWS.

Proposed features:
- AI security guard based on project management software ( An AI categorizes your command and based on rulesets either allows or denies the command being executed. )
- Integration with major agile project managers ( Agile software defined what you will do, and the AI will determine whether it is you or not based on your current tasks )
- Tunable security
- 2FA for security critical commands
- Both inline and transparent modes
- Server and proxy
- Plugin support

### Why though?

AI is coming whether we want/need it or not and I think  that Open Source is the way to go. By Open Source I mean a collaborative, source code openly-accessible project. 

### License TLDR

Traditional open-source licenses are not enough.

I added restrictions because I feel that people should not be regulated, companies and governments are.

* Personal & University & Non-Profit & Small-Team: You are free to use and fork our project as long as you keep the license, state changes ( you know, GPL ) and you can not sell it.  ( small_team.members.length <= 20 )
* Commertial & Business: All of the above, and you have to buy a license. You can not force usage and have to comply with data deletion and have to tell users that they use this software. 
* Special: Feel free to ask anything! You might even get a free license!

### Project values

* Everyone has **equal right to vote** for the direction of the project
* Every change to the license applies onwards. Older versions keep the same license as they had.
* You are free to contribute / have your own version.
