# ✨ Bansshee ✨ 
> The Open Source SSH Server and Proxy Firewall Powered by AI 🧠

### 🚧 Under construction!

This project is yet incomplete and as of now unusable but I am going to develop it in the open.

### 💡 What is this?

Bansshee is my university thesis/hobby project. My goal is to provide an SSH server with some very spicy 🤌 AI features. I want to bring some new and fresh ideas to the table.

Proposed features:
- 🤖 AI security guard based on project management software ( An AI categorizes your command and based on rulesets either allows or denies the command being executed. )
- 📑 Integration with major agile project managers ( Agile software defined what you will do, and the AI will determine whether it is you or not based on your current tasks )
- 🎚️ Tunable security
- 🔐 2FA for security critical commands
- 🥸 Both inline and transparent modes
- 🤘 Server and proxy
- 💫 Plugin support

### 😕 Why though?

AI is coming whether we want/need it or not and I think that Open Source is the way to go. By Open Source I mean a collaborative, source code openly-accessible project. I think that this technology is going to be implemented anyway, and I would rather use mine than some proprietary ones that do who knows what.

### 🧑‍⚖️ License TLDR

* 🌟 Personal & University & Non-Profit & Small-Team: You are free to use and fork our project as long as you keep the license, state changes ( you know, GPL ) and you can not sell it.  ( small_team?.members?.length <= 20 )
* 💰 Commertial & Business: All of the above, and you have to buy a license. You can not force usage and have to comply with data deletion and have to tell users that they use this software. Also can not sell userdata.
* ✨ Special: Feel free to ask anything! You might even get a free license!

* 🌟 Everyone has **equal right to vote** for the direction of the project
* 🌟 Every change to the license applies onwards. Older versions keep the same license as they had.
* 💸 Paid plan owners also get custom plugins and addons that work with Bansshee
* 💸 Paid plan owners also get priority when requesting new features
